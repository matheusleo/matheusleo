# Hello there! I'm Matheus! ðŸ‘¾ 

As I said, my name is Matheus Leonardo and I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·! I started programming on 2020, because I love to help people and I discovered that, through it, I could help many of them.

Today, I work as intern on a brazilian edtech named [Layers Education](https://layers.education) and pursue the dream to become a Cadet at [42Sp](https://42sp.org.br).
