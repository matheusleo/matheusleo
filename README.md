        As I said, my name is Matheus Leonardo and I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·! I started programming on 2020, because I love to help people and I discovered that, through it, I could help many of them.

        Today, I work as intern on a brazilian edtech named  <a href="https://layers.education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Layers Education</a> and pursue the dream to become a Cadet at <a href="https://42sp.org.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        42Sp</a>.

## What I like to do?

I have many hobbies (maybe too many hobbies): I love to learn about programming, sciences and storytelling - stories and myths are what shapes us.
